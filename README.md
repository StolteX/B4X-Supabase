Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. It provides all the backend services you need to build a product. Supabase uses Postgres database with real-time capabilities. Basically, supabase provides an interface to manage postgres database that you can use to create table and insert, edit and delete data in the table.

We can use REST API or client libraries from supabase to access the data in the postgres database. Supabase is not just about accessing the database. it also provides some solutions out of the box such as Authentication, File Storage and Real-time capabilities.
